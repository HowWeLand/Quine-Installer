# Quine-Installer
This is an automated bootstrap installer built in shell script for Devuan.  Feedback would be nice!

I am aware it's not a real Quine

## This is Phase 1

This script represents the first phase of a larger project to create reproducible, 
documented, secure computing environments.

Why "Phase 1"? Because:
- It only handles installation
- It doesn't yet include the analysis tools
- The real work (security research, system analysis) comes next

Built while figuring out life's other variables. Sometimes focus finds you.

## Context

Built in 6 months while navigating housing instability. Proof that deep work 
can happen anywhere, with enough determination.

Sometimes the best code comes from the hardest circumstances.
