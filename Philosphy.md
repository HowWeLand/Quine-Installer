## Origin Story

This started as "I should automate my Kali Linux install" and became something else entirely.

Kali provides tools for security research but doesn't address the foundational problems:
- How do you reproduce your research environment exactly?
- How do you document every security choice?
- How do you ensure forensic cleanliness?
- How do you maintain the system while minimizing attack surface?

This script answers those questions. It's not Kali - it's the **reproducible, documented, secure research base** I wanted Kali to be.

Sometimes you don't find the right tool. Sometimes you have to build it.
